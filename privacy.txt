The only data that is saved or accessed is the data that the user inputs into the app to enable the app to accomplish its goal of helping people find a good college fit for them.  This information is for displaying information, such as added colleges, ratings for those colleges, or notes about those colleges.  Crash logs may be automatically transferred to a server, but the data will not be used to identify individuals, but rather to fix bugs and crashes in the app.  If you want data to be deleted, please contact the owner through the store.
